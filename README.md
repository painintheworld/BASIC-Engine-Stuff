# BASIC-Engine-Stuff
...a public place to drop some BASIC Engine BASIC code snippets and programs; likely badly coded.

This particular program is for a friend on FB. He had asked me for some simple code to 
load, display, and move sprites on the BASIC Engine NG platform.
There are numerous REMark statements at the beginning of the program. If you have any
questions, hit me up :) I need to learn to use GitHub, so please excuse the mess!
